# Give Artifact Plugin
idk why this wasnt done ages ago and ever since exzork arti website died i have been sad.
its simple as frick to understand, almost impossible to screw up.

## Basics of this plugin

### Calling

 -> `/ga` or `/giveartifact` or `/gart' to call this command

### Usage

 -> `/ga [artifactId] [mainstatName] [substatName]=[substatValue] [level]` 

	-> creates an artifact from the given details 
	
	-> (% are 1 - 100) so cdmg=7.8 is 7.8% of crit damage

	-> eg `/ga 21543 hp% cr=23.4 cdmg=46.7 def=55 cdr=100 21`
		-> `21543` => `Gilded Dreams Flower`  [required]
		-> `hp%`   => `mainstat name`	      [not required]
		-> `cr`    => `substat1 name`         [not required]
		-> `23.4`  => `substat1 value`        [not required]
		
		-> `etc...`

		-> `21`    => `artifact level (1-21)` [not required, defaut is max]

 -> `godset function not available yet`

-> DO NOT USE WITH TAMILPP RESOURCES FOR NOW AS THE AFFIX STATS ARE OUTDATED
